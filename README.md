# Pwnage
## An API interface for "Have I Been Pwned"

Provides a web based GUI with Streamlit to make API calls easy. Data transformation is handled with Pandas and Python data type primitives.

### TODO
- Add user input control for different parameters
- Consider multithreading in response to rate limiting
- Provide greater utility for file navigation
- Allow for exporting different file formats


If you have pipenv installed, running the application is simple.
```console
pipenv install
pipenv run streamlit run main.py
```
